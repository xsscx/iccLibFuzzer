ICC XML ROUND-TRIP SUMMARY
==========================
Total ICC files tested : 398
Round-trip PASS        : 291
FAIL at iccToXml       : 2
FAIL at iccFromXml     : 105

Observations:
- iccFromXml failures are dominated by Calculator MPE grammar limitations (ULL/UL tokens).
- Profiles without Calculator MPEs generally round-trip successfully.

Action Items:
1. Extend iccFromXml calculator grammar to accept typed integer tokens (ULL, UL, etc.).
2. Or canonicalize calculator literals in iccToXml output.
3. Treat ICC→XML as non-bijective for Calculator MPE profiles until fixed.
